# Grindstone (for the fx-CG50)

This project is a **recreation of Grindstone** using C and fxsdk for the fx-CG50 calculator.

Created using gint and fxsdk in the language C, this is my attempt to recreate Grindstone, a puzzle game,</br>
for the fx-CG50 calculator. Grindstone is a game where you smash through monsters of the same color (simply).

<h2>✰ About</h2>
After writing Block Blast, I found myself playing Grindstone (https://www.capybaragames.com/games/grindstone) through Apple Arcade, and wanted to recreate it. Simply speaking, the game has this core functionality: the player is Jorj, and you need to smash through creeps (monsters) of the same color to create chains. 10+ in a chain creates a grindstone, which lets you switch creep color mid chain. You also need to beat bosses and different kinds of monsters while traversing through the levels. This game is meant to be a simpler version of that.
